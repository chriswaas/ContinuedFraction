# ContinuedFraction

This is my final project. It is a program to approximate any number with a rational number.

Test status: [![Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/32r7s2skrgm9ubva?retina=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/chriswaas/continuedfraction)

At the moment, there are still issues with 32-bit systems because the tests exceed the Int32 range.
